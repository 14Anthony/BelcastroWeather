Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

Hello:

I hope you enjoy this interactive weather application search by city, and find your current weather, and five day forcast.  I used the Open Weather api to access the database of information that you find.  My father is an avid weather watcher as he is retired here in Tucson, AZ, and  I hope he likes it to.

## User Story

```
As A traveler I like to be on the move, and in that movement it is important to know what to pack.  So in the travel I like to have the option for multiple cities at a click

When you open you will be aple to search for the weather with a city name, and the application will allow for that former search to be revisited by simply clicking on the button created after each search on the left of the screen.  


Know this will allow you to plan a trip accordingly
```

WHEN you search for a city
THEN you will see current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN you view current weather conditions for that city
THEN you will be  presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN you view future weather conditions for that city
THEN you are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN you click on a city in the search history
THEN you are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
